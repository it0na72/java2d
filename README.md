# Java 2D Adventure Game 

This is a Java 2D adventure game and also my final bootcamp project. The intention of this game is to demonstrate what I have learned 
in the bootcamp, plus a couple more things I managed to learn on my own. This is still being updated on a daily basis. Eventually I plan on adding external libraries to make more functions.

### How to Install: 
- You can find the latest release of the game by downloading the game [**HERE**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QU1nY_8M9cP4EFEeNhR0vyUOah9SNqin/view?usp=sharing). You will need to have JDK installed in your system.
	
### How to Play:
- Use WASD to move (W = up, A = left, S = right, D = right) the character and try to finish the game by killing monsters and finding
the treasure. There is a couple of easter eggs within the game, so please let me know if you find them! 
	
### What I have learned with this project:
- Create a game loop
- Display player character
- Display background tiles
- Display objects
- Create monsters (simple AI) and Battle System (hit detection)
- Collision detection between NPC's and players
- Added an invincible state after hitting a monster
- Create battle system (also boss fights)
- Create NPCs & Dialogue system
- Create player inventory
- Create title screen & game state (pause game, game over screen & save/load game)

### Future plans:
- This game is still being updated on a regular basis. I have a lot of other features I would love to include, including different maps,
different classes (fighter, mage, archer, etc), different monsters, different songs depending on the monster you're fighting, and even
different dimensions, environment interaction (cutting trees with axe), In-game Menu and different maps (map transitions). However, all of these are not my current priority. 

### Current bugs (TBC):
- [x] FIXED ~~There is no sound effects or music in the game yet. I added all the sound files but they are still not working. Will try to fix this as soon as possible~~
- [x] FIXED ~~Healing fountain location is slightly bugged. You need to be in the EXACT tile for it to work~~
- [x] FIXED ~~If you spam the healing fountain, you will get more health than you currently have (eg: if you have maximum health and you use the healing fountain, you get 3 extra hearts on top of that)~~
- [x] FIXED ~~Monsters deal damage when they're in their dying animation~~
- [ ] Attack animation is slightly out of focus
