# Java 2D Adventure Game 

This is a Java 2D adventure game and also my final bootcamp project. The intention of this game is to demonstrate what I have learned 
in the bootcamp, plus a couple more things I managed to learn on my own. This is not being updated anymore, however if anything comes to my mind, I will eventually add more monsters and even different maps.

### Future plans:
- [x] Completed ~~This game is still being updated on a regular basis. I have a lot of other features I would love to include, including different maps,
different classes (fighter, mage, archer, etc), different monsters, different songs depending on the monster you're fighting, and even
different dimensions, environment interaction (cutting trees with axe), In-game Menu and different maps (map transitions). However, all of these are not my current priority. ~~
- [ ] Increasing the map and adding more different monsters

### Current bugs (TBC):
- [x] FIXED ~~There is no sound effects or music in the game yet. I added all the sound files but they are still not working. Will try to fix this as soon as possible~~
- [x] FIXED ~~Healing fountain location is slightly bugged. You need to be in the EXACT tile for it to work~~
- [x] FIXED ~~If you spam the healing fountain, you will get more health than you currently have (eg: if you have maximum health and you use the healing fountain, you get 3 extra hearts on top of that)~~
- [x] FIXED ~~Monsters deal damage when they're in their dying animation~~
- [ ] Attack animation is slightly out of focus
