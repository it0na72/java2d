# Adventure Time - A 2D Retro Game! 

This is a 2D adventure game and also my final bootcamp project. The intention of this game is to demonstrate what I have learned 
in the bootcamp, plus a couple more things I managed to learn on my own. This is not being updated anymore, however if anything comes to my mind, I will eventually add more monsters and even different maps.

### How to Play:
- Controls
	- Movement - **WASD**

### Game Items/Techniques
Here are some important features and mechanics to help you navigate through your adventure:
1. **Guard:** Protect yourself from enemy attacks by blocking half the damage.

2. **Parry:** With precise timing, you can parry an enemy attack and gain a critical hit chance for one second, which doubles your damage output.

3. **Ninja:** As a skilled ninja, you can use your weapon to cut through incoming projectiles. However, timing is crucial in this technique.

4. **Survivor:** Your surroundings can be destroyed to aid in your battle. Choose your weapons wisely to maximize your destruction potential.

5. **Healing Pool:** Recover your life and mana by taking a dip in a nearby pool, but beware that monsters will respawn upon your return.

6. **Coins:** Visit the merchant and purchase stronger items to give yourself an edge in battle.

7. **Tent:** Rest and replenish your energy by sleeping until the next day.

8. **Lantern:** When the sun sets, the importance of your lantern becomes apparent. Keep it handy to navigate through the darkness.


The goal of the game? Solve the **dungeon puzzle**, kill the **final boss** and get the **treasure**.

### Future plans:
- [x] Completed ~~This game is still being updated on a regular basis. I have a lot of other features I would love to include, including different maps,
different classes (fighter, mage, archer, etc), different monsters, different songs depending on the monster you're fighting, and even
different dimensions, environment interaction (cutting trees with axe), In-game Menu and different maps (map transitions). However, all of these are not my current priority.~~
- [ ] Increasing the map and add different monsters
- [ ] Possibly host the game online
- [ ] Add different monsters

### Current bugs (TBC):
- [x] FIXED ~~There is no sound effects or music in the game yet. I added all the sound files but they are still not working. Will try to fix this as soon as possible~~
- [x] FIXED ~~Healing fountain location is slightly bugged. You need to be in the EXACT tile for it to work~~
- [x] FIXED ~~If you spam the healing fountain, you will get more health than you currently have (eg: if you have maximum health and you use the healing fountain, you get 3 extra hearts on top of that)~~
- [x] FIXED ~~Monsters deal damage when they're in their dying animation~~
- [ ] Attack animation is slightly out of focus 
- [ ] Attack range is slightly out of place

# Special Thanks
Thank you to RyiSnow for providing the world tiles and npc sprites, and Game Endeavor for the character sprites. This wouldn't have been possible without their support.
