# Java 2D Adventure Game 


This is a Java 2D adventure game and also my final bootcamp project. The intention of this game is to demonstrate what I have learned 
in the bootcamp, plus a couple more I managed to learn on my own.

- How to Play
- What I have learned with this project
- Future plans 
- Screenshots of the game
	
### How to Install: 
- You can clone this repo, open this with Intellij and start the game. Alternatively, you can find the latest release of the game by downloading the Jar file in this repository. You will need to have Java installed in 
your system (TBC).
	
### How to Play:
- Use WASD to move (W = up, A = left, S = right, D = right) the character and try to finish the game by killing monsters and finding
the treasure. There is a couple of easter eggs within the game, so please let me know if you find them! 
	
### What I have learned with this project:
- Create a game loop
- Display player character
- Display background tiles
- Display objects
- Create monsters (simple AI) and Battle System (hit detection)
- Collision detection between NPC's and players
- Added an invincible state after hitting a monster
- Create battle system (also boss fights)
- Create NPCs & Dialogue system
- Create inventory
- Create title screen & game state (pause game, game over screen & save/load game)

### Future plans:
- This game is still being updated on a regular basis. I have a lot of other features I would love to include, including different maps,
different classes (fighter, mage, archer, etc), different monsters, different songs depending on the monster you're fighting, and even
different dimensions, environment interaction (cutting trees with axe), In-game Menu and different maps (map transitions). However, all of these are not my current priority.
